# Komorebi

This Project implements two different approaches to achieve volumetric lighting effects. The first one uses a radial blur to add "God-Rays" to a Scene. The second approach uses ray-marching to achieve full-blown volumetric lighting and even factors in atmospheric scattering. The Project is written from scratch with C# and OpenTK. Assimp-Net is used to load the models for the scene. Further details can be found in the paper **Komorebi.pdf** (in german). 
Inspired by Volumetric Lighting in Lords of the Fallen (https://de.slideshare.net/BenjaminGlatzel/volumetric-lighting-for-many-lights-in-lords-of-the-fallen).
